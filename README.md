Goal:

Build a live prototype for a simple hotel website and reservation system. Design the webiste to give all important information to users like room types, tariffs, activities and location. Also add a section where users can put in their special requests / queries. 

Integrated a conversational chatbot built on a Large Language Model (LLM) to help users get instant answers to common customer queries. The chatbot is designed to simulate real customer support interactions — providing personalized, context-aware responses that enhance user experience and reduce manual support overhead.

Designed and implemented an automated email workflow to improve user engagement and trust during the reservation process. When a user submits a reservation request, the system instantly triggers a personalized confirmation email containing booking details. This was achieved by integrating an email service (e.g., Resend API / Lovable’s automation layer) that ensures reliable, real-time delivery
